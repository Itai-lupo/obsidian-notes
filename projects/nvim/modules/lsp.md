## description

lsp along side dap and formatting/linting are part that connect nvim to other programming tools such as clangd and gdb, this is realty important for programming.
nvim provide a lsp client as part of the lua API and there are lots of plugins that help setting it up but with formatting, linting and debugging(dap) things aren't quite as easy.
this module should allow for easy set up of all of this things using json or lua files in ether the config files or the project files and provide easy and good integration with [[cmp-nvim-lua]], [[[[mason.nvi]] and allow for language specific shortcuts such as M-o to move from src and header files in c and cpp.
it should also allow for easy config of the quality of life features that lsp allows.

the bottom line is making the programming experience as easy and fast as possible.
