## description

new tale game engine at the moment is build like a prof of concept.
many of it's main modules are sort of hacked up and it is not up to standard(what even is standard?).
the goal of this CDR is first to set a standard and more concrete goals for the project(*at the end!*).
after setting the standard there will be need to be a plan in order to bring the whole engine up to this standard.
after that there will need to be a plan in order to keep it up to that standard and a future plan with all the wanted features and there state that will be build out of the current list of goals but is a waterfall plan with date goals and a when finished.

## current state
### modules list

there are 2 main modules at the moment, window api(at the moment only for linux wayland) and render api(for openGL and Vulkan).

there is some integration between the 2 modules but it isn't the cleanest.
also the rendering API and window API openGL support should be removed because openGL is bad.
