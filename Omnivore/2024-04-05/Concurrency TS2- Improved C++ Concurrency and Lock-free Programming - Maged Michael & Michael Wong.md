Concurrency TS2: Improved C++ Concurrency and Lock-free Programming - Maged Michael and Michael Wong - CppCon 2023
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023

After the two initial content of Hazard Pointers and RCU was voted into Concurrency TS2 in the June 2021 virtual plenary, we have finally added 3 additional features from the Kona C++ Standard meeting in 2022 (the first F2F after the pandemic). These new features completes the Concurrency TS2 and now it is finally being sent to Geneva as a PDTS for eventual publication as an ISO TS after we address any comments in the next Kona meeting in November, 2023. It seems reasonable that Concurrency TS2 will be published in early 2024.

This talk will describe all the features and show how they can used as described in N4956. It contains:
-Synchronized Value
-Safe Reclamation which contains Hazard Pointers and RCU
-Bytewise Atomic Memcpy
-Asymmetric Fence

We will show the use cases of each and describe how some of them are already heading to C++26 as the initial entries to the C++26 working draft. This will help programmers in concurrency, lock-free programming, low-latency applications how to take advantage of each of these important facilities.

Maged Michael

Maged Michael is the inventor of several concurrent algorithms including hazard pointers, lock-free allocation, and multiple concurrent data structure algorithms. His code and algorithms are widely-used in standard libraries and production. His 2002 paper on hazard pointers received the 2022 Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing, and his 2004 paper on lock-free allocation received the 2014 ACM SIGPLAN Most Influential PLDI Paper Award.
