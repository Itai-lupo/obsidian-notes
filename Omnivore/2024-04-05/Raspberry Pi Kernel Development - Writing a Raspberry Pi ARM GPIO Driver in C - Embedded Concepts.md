## description
>[!summary] 
> In this video, we talk about the purpose of drivers and why they are necessary when working on embedded systems. Later, we go over how to install the Raspberry Pi kernel headers and use them to write a kernel driver for the device. Finally, we install the kernel driver and prove that it is running on our device. This is part one in a video series for creating a GPIO driver for the Raspberry Pi!
