== DESCRIPTION == 
I'm dabi, a doctor and YouTuber, and I've made the single most in-depth YouTube guide to Obsidian on the internet. I've created this 13-part course that was initially $97, but now I've released it to you for free!

This is my opinionated guide to how I use Obsidian as a Second Brain and Zettelkasten. 
- Make Obsidian a digital Second Brain, so that you never ever forget anything you think about 
- Use Obsidian as a Zettelkasten 
- Capture thoughts extremely quickly, without worrying about structure until later 
- Use Obsidian's powerful search functions to find anything you've ever thought about 
- Synthesise and distill important ideas as part of a Zettelkasten, so that your most important thoughts are always top of mind 
- ...and more! 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time on this course (a *ridiculous* amount), because originally I set out to make the most in-depth paid course. 

📚 Make sure to bookmark it and share it with your friends, so you can come back to it as needed! There's no need to do it in one go, as originally it was meant to be done one lesson at a time. 

🎉 THIS VIDEO IS FULLY SUBTITLED. I've tried to make the subtitles as accurate as possible, to make things easier to understand, so I recommend turning them on. :) but I do apologise if I mess up here and there.
