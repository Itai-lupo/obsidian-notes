Using Modern C++ to Eliminate Virtual Functions - Jonathan Gopel - CppCon 2022
https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2022


As of C++20, there are no cases in which statically linked programs require virtual functions. This talk will explore techniques for replacing runtime polymorphism with compile-time polymorphism such that virtual functions are never necessary. This talk will also address the higher-order concern of when it might make sense to avoid virtual functions or remove them from a codebase, as that decision ultimately is a design decision that only the author of the code can make. Attendees can expect to come away with a stronger understanding of the purposes of virtual functions and the mechanisms in modern C++ that can now be used to achieve those same purposes.
