## note
>[!note] 
>   Git Worktree is somewhat of a niche feature in Git that too few developers know about. It allows you to change branches and contexts without ever having to stash your changes or commit and reset.
However, it can be quite the hassle when not maintained well and having to work with the CLI.
In this video I'll go through the best practices including a sweet Neovim plugin that makes the experience silky smooth!
